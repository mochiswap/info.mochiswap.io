# ðŸŒ‰ Bridging assets

Mochiswap is cross-chain \(BSC and Harmony\). If you would like to move assets from one chain to the other, you can do that through the [**Horizon Bridge**](https://bridge.harmony.one/erc20)**.**

\*\*\*\*[**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvhAuhz4okI) is a small instructional video on how to bridge assets from BSC to Harmony and vice versa.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Bridging is a very handy way of getting assets from one chain to the other. However, you need to be careful to do it properly. You can ask questions about bridging in [**this official Harmony group**](https://bridge.harmony.one)**,**

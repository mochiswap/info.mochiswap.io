# 🍡 Introduction

## What is Mochiswap?

[**Mochiswap**](https://mochiswap.io) is one of the leading DEXes on the [**Harmony**](https://www.harmony.one) \*\*\*\*blockchain. Mochiswap is led by a passionate and knowledgeable team of developers and it offers a wide range of products/features.

Mochiswap was one of the first DEXes launched **(March 28, 2021)** on the Harmony blockchain and it's been growing steadily.

The Mochi community is very active on all social medias and it is one of the main reasons why Mochiswap is an amazing project!

{% hint style="info" %}
Mochiswap is also cross-chain (BSC and Harmony at the moment)! The main focus is currently on the Harmony side of the DEX but the BSC side is also being actively worked on. 💜

## **Features**

Mochiswap has multiple amazing features!

### 🚜 Farms

Pair LP tokens and farm hMOCHI & bMochi. Mochiswap has a wide selection of LP farms so there should be something for everyone! The current multiplier for the farms is at 1X so the selling pressure is minimal.

### 🌺 Single staking

Mochiswap also gives you the option to single stake your tokens (both hMOCHI and bMochi). APY is lower when compared to the farms, but if you're not feeling adventurous, Mochiswap has got you covered!

### 🚀 ONEMOON

ONEMOON is a token developed by the Mochi team with tokenomics very similar to SAFEMOON. ONEMOON is also being used to burn hMOCHI. **So far 2.5 million hMOCHIs have been burnt out of a total supply of 100 million!**

### 🔥 xMOCHI

xMOCHI is one of the latest releases for the Harmony side of the DEX. You can stake your hMOCHIs and when a buyback & burn happens (usually randomly), you can unstake your hMOCHI and you will have a bigger balance of hMOCHI than you initially did!

### 🔒 Security

Mochiswap has multi-sig for the community treasury! That means that the funds are under the control of a 3 party multisig wallet with the cooperation of the Harmony team and two of its known and trusted multisig participants. So in short, treasury funds are SAFU. You can read more about the multi-sig wallet [**HERE**](https://mochiswap.medium.com/introducing-multi-sig-on-mochiswap-bd5a7af5c278).

### 🔜 More features coming soon!

The Mochi team is working to push out more features/products in the near future! Keep an eye out for the Mochi gang 😉
